## Cafeteria Management System

The Cafeteria Management System is a relational database management system (RDBMS) designed to streamline operations and enhance efficiency in a cafeteria environment. It provides functionalities for managing users, menu items, orders, payments, and staff members.

### Tables:

1. **USERS**: Stores information about users who interact with the system, including their user ID, username, password, and role (e.g., admin, staff).

2. **MENU**: Contains details of menu items available in the cafeteria, such as the menu ID, name, price, and description.

3. **ORDER_DETAILS**: Stores information about orders placed by users, including the order ID, user ID, date, and total amount.

4. **ORDER_ITEM**: Tracks the items included in each order, with details such as the order item ID, order ID, menu ID, quantity, and unit.

5. **PAYMENT**: Records payment details for orders, including the payment ID, order ID, amount, and payment method.

6. **STAFF**: Manages staff members working in the cafeteria, storing their staff ID, username, password, and role.

### Features:

- **User Management**: Allows administrators to manage user accounts, including creating, updating, and deleting accounts. Users can have different roles, such as admin or staff.

- **Menu Management**: Enables administrators to add, update, or remove menu items from the system. Each menu item includes details like name, price, and description.

- **Order Placement**: Users can place orders for menu items, specifying the quantity of each item they want to purchase.

- **Order Tracking**: Provides functionality to track the status of orders, including details of items ordered, total amount, and payment status.

- **Payment Processing**: Facilitates secure payment processing for orders, supporting various payment methods.

- **Staff Management**: Allows administrators to manage staff accounts, including adding new staff members and assigning roles.

### Usage:

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in using their username and password to access the system.

2. **Menu Selection**: Users browse the menu and select items they want to order.

3. **Order Placement**: Users place orders by specifying the quantity of each item they want to purchase.

4. **Payment**: Users proceed to payment, where they choose a payment method and complete the transaction.

5. **Order Fulfillment**: Staff members receive order details, prepare the items, and mark orders as fulfilled upon completion.

### Benefits:

- **Efficiency**: Streamlines cafeteria operations by automating order processing, payment handling, and menu management.

- **Accuracy**: Reduces manual errors in order taking, calculation, and payment processing.

- **Customer Satisfaction**: Enhances the overall dining experience for customers by providing a seamless ordering and payment process.

- **Data Insights**: Generates reports and analytics on sales, popular items, and customer preferences, enabling informed decision-making.

# Library Management System

## Overview

The Library Management System is a database application designed to streamline library operations by efficiently managing books, authors, members, transactions, and fines. This project utilizes SQL to create a robust database schema, implement views for data retrieval, define triggers for enforcing data integrity, and provide procedures for user-friendly data insertion.

## Features

- **Database Schema:** Defines tables for Authors, Books, Members, Transactions, and Fines with appropriate fields to store comprehensive information.
- **Views:** Offers simplified access to data through views such as Author Information, Book Details with Author, Member Profiles, Transaction Records, and Fine Details with Transaction Information.
- **Triggers:** Enforces data integrity rules to maintain database consistency, including prevention of author deletion associated with books, insertion of books with valid authors, avoidance of duplicate member emails, and ensuring accurate transaction details.
- **User Input Inserts:** Implements procedures for user interaction to facilitate seamless data insertion into the database, enhancing usability and data entry efficiency.

## Files Structure

- `schema.sql`: Contains SQL scripts for creating the database schema, including tables, views, and triggers, and inserting initial data.
- `user_input_inserts.sql`: Provides SQL code for procedures facilitating user-driven data insertion into the database.
- `README.md`: Presents an overview of the project, its features, usage instructions, and contribution guidelines.

## Usage

1. **Database Setup:** Execute the SQL code in `schema.sql` to create the database structure, including tables, views, and triggers.
2. **Data Insertion:** Optionally, use the SQL code in `user_input_inserts.sql` to insert data into the database using user-friendly prompts.
3. **Interact with Database:** Utilize SQL queries to interact with the database, retrieve information, perform operations, and manage library resources effectively.
